I'm a freelance web developer and designer who's interested in AIGC for design. I create illustrations in Krita and Inkscape and open source artwork files and tutorials here. I build web-based and Electron applications that embed AIGC algorithms and design systems that enable efficient development of accessible, replicable user interfaces / experiences.
